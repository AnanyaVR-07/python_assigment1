a) Define a variable in Python. Provide an example of how to create a variable that stores your name.

Varaible acts as an address for where the data is stored in memeory

in variables we can change the data but in constants we can't change data it is fixed. no it can't have any constant in varible

"""5.a) What is type casting? Explain the difference between implicit and explicit type casting with examples.

type casting:the process of converting one data type into another form

In implicit type casting, the programming language automatically converts data from one type to another if needed. For example, if you have an integer variable and you try to assign it to a float variable, the programming language will automatically convert the integer to a float without you having to do anything.

Explicit type casting, also known as type conversion, occurs when the programmer explicitly converts a value from one data type to another. Unlike implicit type casting, explicit type casting requires the programmer to specify the desired data typeÂ conversion.

1.
Converts a float to an integer.
